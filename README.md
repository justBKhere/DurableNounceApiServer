## DurableNounceApiServer



### Introduction

DurableNounceApiServer is a test implementation of nonces in games, aimed at adding more mechanics and flexibility to game development. It also includes a basic wallet implementation for in-game transactions. Please note that this project is a work in progress and not ready for production. For production-level implementations, we recommend using "On3 Account," our game account solution with enhanced features, which will be accessible in the next few weeks.

The durable nonce implementation will be studied further and developed in-depth going forward.

### Features
